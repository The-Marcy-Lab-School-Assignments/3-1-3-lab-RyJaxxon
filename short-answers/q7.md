# Question

What are at least 2 benefits to using:

```html
<script type="module" src="index.js"></script>
```

Instead of:

```html
<script src="index.js"></script>
```

# Answer

1. The modules type allows us to take use of ES6 Modules, making our code cleaner and easier to navigate. One of the ways this happens is by enabling our use of import and export to share chunks of code between files.

2. It also makes scoping problems easier! Since variables declared in a module are scoped to that module.
