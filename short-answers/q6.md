# Question

What does `element.append()` do? What is an advantage it has over `element.appendChild()`?

# Answer

`element.append` can take multiple arguments including strings and nodes, and appends them to a parent element of your choice.

`element.appendChild()` is similar, but can only accept one argument which is restricted to nodes. Additionally it attaches itself as the last child in the desired parent element.
